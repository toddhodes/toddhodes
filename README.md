- Currently Iâ€™m working at Eluvio, a Berkeley media content distribution startup
- Before that I worked at LocationLabs as Director of Mobile Engineering for many years, which became AVG and then Avast
- I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, and did my undergrad at UVa
- I was raised in Atlanta, Georgia
- Fun fact: I co-own a bar and executive produce albums & shorts; people made (incomplete) IMDB and Discog pages for me!
