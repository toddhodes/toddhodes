<!--
**toddhodes/toddhodes** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on fixing the Android infrastructure at Wish.com
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about the last 3 decades of computer science
- âš¡ Fun fact: I co-own a bar in Bloomington, the Orbit Room, with live music and pinball; I produce albums for Brave Scarecrowe (Americana), Outer Sounds (West coast world music), the Rabbit Hole Orchestra, and Quinn DeVeaux
