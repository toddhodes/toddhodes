### Hi there

- Currently Iâ€™m working at Eluvio, a Berkeley media content management & distribution startup, mostly we do video streaming
- Before that I worked at LocationLabs as Senior Scientist & Director of Mobile Engineering for many years, which became AVG and then Avast
- I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, did my undergrad at UVa, and was raised in Dunwoody (Atlanta), Georgia 
- Fun fact: I co-own a bar, the Orbit Room in Bloomington, and I'm the executive producer of some albums on various small indie record labels, and a few short films; people made (incomplete) IMDB and Discog pages for me!

for my real commit history, my work github is https://github.com/elv-todd
