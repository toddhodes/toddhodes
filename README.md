- 🔭 Currently I’m working on Android infrastructure at wish.com (ContextLogic).  I've only been to the office (1 Sansome) once due to Covid.
- 🥼 Previously I worked at LocationLabs for about 18 years, my entire post-PhD career.  We sold it to AVG in Oct 2014 (now Avast).
- 📚 I received my PhD in Computer Science from UC Berkeley, and did my undergrad at UVa.
- 🏡 I was raised in Atlanta, Georgia
- ⚡ Fun fact: I co-founded and co-own a bar, and I've been the executive producer of a bunch of albums.
