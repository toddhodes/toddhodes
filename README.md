- 🔭 Currently: I’m working on fixing the Android infrastructure at Wish.com
- 🔭 Previously: I worked at LocationLabs for 18 years(!).  "We" (really, my CEO) sold it to AVG for $220MM in Oct 2014.
- 💬 Ask me about: pretty much anything from the last 3 decades of computer science.  I'm a CS history buff.
- ⚡ Fun fact: I co-own a bar in Bloomington, the Orbit Room, with live music and pinball; I've produced albums for Brave Scarecrowe (Americana), Outer Sounds (West coast world music), the Rabbit Hole Orchestra (psychedelic rock), and Quinn DeVeaux (soul, blues, R&B)
