- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m: currently working on fixing the Android infrastructure at Wish.com
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: pretty much anything from the last 3 decades of computer science.  I'm a CS history buff.
- âš¡ Fun fact: I co-own a bar in Bloomington, the Orbit Room, with live music and pinball; I've produced albums for Brave Scarecrowe (Americana), Outer Sounds (West coast world music), the Rabbit Hole Orchestra (psychedelic rock), and Quinn DeVeaux (soul, blues, and R&B)
