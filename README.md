- ðŸ”­ Currently: Iâ€™m working on fixing the Android infrastructure at Wish.com
- ðŸ”­ Previously: I worked at LocationLabs for 18 years.  We sold it to AVG for $220MM in Oct 2014.
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about: pretty much anything from the last three decades of computer science.  I'm a CS history buff, who had lots of time to study it during my PhD career at Berkeley.
- âš¡ Fun facts: I co-founded and co-own a bar in Bloomington, UN -- the Orbit Room -- with live music and pinball; I've been the executive producer of albums for Brave Scarecrowe (Americana), Outer Sounds (West coast world music), the Rabbit Hole Orchestra (psychedelic rock), and Quinn DeVeaux (soul, blues, R&B)
